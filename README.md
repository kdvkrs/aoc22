# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions for the 
[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) 
challenges as well as the utilities I use for improving my Advent of Code
workflow. These utilities are kept in a [separate repository](https://github.com/kdvkrs/aoc_util)
(which contains more information about them as well as their intended usage) and
which is secondary upstream for this repository (so it doesn't have to be forked multiple times).
